## Color Calibation Notes

As some of us don't have color calibrated displays, the chosen color palette of **Brownways** might look too colorful with your display. Unfortunately, it took a while to find a good compromize of colors for this amber colored theme.

If you experience a *too coloful* theme, you might reconsider your monitor's color saturation settings. From my experience, the chosen colors are working well, with those displays I could test it.

In general LED diplays tend to be very sensitive to orange and amber colored UIs. It's easier to have a blueish theme. This is normal as expected. Current LED technology isn't able to show a wide spectrum of brownish colors well. Therefore, I would recommend trying to adjust display saturation might help here. Even small changes can make the huge difference in **Brownways's** finsh.

I tested **Borwnways** for the last weeks and I think it's ok to publish it now. Hopefully, you can enjoy this theme. Justknow **Brownways** is very color caliration fagile.

## Issues

PLease report issues you find. as I couln't test all color settings. I will pick your issue reports as soon as possible.
