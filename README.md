## Color Calibation Notes

As some don't have perfectly color calibrated display settings, the chosen color palette of **Brownways** might look too coloful. It took a while to find the right colors for **Brownways** theme.

If you experience a *very coloful* experience with **Brownways** you might consider desatureate your monitor's color saturation a bit. From my experience, the chosen colors are working well, with less colorful settings. Diplays tend to be very sensitive to orange and amber color settinge. It's much easier to choose a blueish than a brownish color theme. This is normal as current LED technology isn't able to show those colors in a wide spectrum. Therefore, small display saturation adjustments can easily make the huge experience in **Brownways** finsh.

I tried to find a compromize, which looks ok with my displays. Hopefully, it's also working for you. If not, then try to reduce your display's saturation just a tiny bit. Don't change too much **Brownways** is very fagile.
